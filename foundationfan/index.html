<h3>1. Reputation </h3>

<img src="images/reputation.jpg" align="center" border="0" alt="reputation" title="reputation" width="500" height="500">

<p>Reputation is my favorite album because it shows how far she's come as an artist and I love the mentality behind it.
</p>

<h3>2. Speak Now </h3>

<img src="images/speaknow.jpg" align="center" border="0" alt="speak now" title="speaknow" width="500" height="500">

<p>Speak now is next because I grew up listening to it and Enchanted is one of my favorite songs. While I might listen to the other ones more right now, it gets the second spot because this is album I listened to as a kid that made me become a fan.
</p>

<h3>3. Red (Taylor's Version) </h3>

<img src="images/Red.jpeg" align="center" border="0" alt="Red" title="Red" width="500" height="500">

<p>Red is next because it's a very scream-able album whether you're in a bad or good mood.
</p>

<h3>4. Lover </h3>

<img src="images/lover.png" align="center" border="0" alt="Lover" title="Lover" width="500" height="500">

<p>Lover is next because I always turn to these songs when I need a pick-me-up. It's very calming and peaceful. 
</p>

<h3>5. folklore </h3>

<img src="images/folklore.jpeg" align="center" border="0" alt="folklore" title="folklore" width="500" height="500">

<p>Folklore is next because its very calming and I always turn it on to study. I also appreciate the range it shows in her work.
</p>

<h3>6. Fearless (Taylor's Version)</h3>

<img src="images/fear.png" align="center" border="0" alt="Fearless" title="Fearless" width="500" height="500">

<p>Fearless has so many iconic songs on it that I grew up listening to. However, it's here I just don't turn to it as much as the others.
</p>

<h3>7. 1989 </h3>

<img src="images/1989.png" align="center" border="0" alt="1989" title="1989" width="500" height="500">

<p>1989 is a bop but again just isn't one I turn on as much.
</p>

<h3>8. Taylor Swift </h3>

<img src="images/taylorswift.png" align="center" border="0" alt="Taylor Swift" title="Taylor Swift" width="500" height="500">

<p>The only songs I really listen to on this one are Picture to Burn and Our Song, which are favorites but this album as a whole just isn't my favorite.
</p>

<h3>9. evermore </h3>

<img src="images/evermore.png" align="center" border="0" alt="evermore" title="evermore" width="500" height="500">

<p>I like Champagne Problems but don't really listen to any of the other songs on this album.
</p>
